  This ethernet simulation is based on the PCAP and WinPcap packages.

  PCAP/WinPcap was chosen as the basis for network code since it is the most
  "universal" of the various network packages available. Using this style has
  allowed rapid network development for the major SIMH platforms. Developing
  a network package specifically for SIMH was rejected due to the time required;
  the advantage would be a more easily compiled and integrated code set.

  There are various problems associated with use of ethernet networking, which
  would be true regardless of the network package used, since there are no
  universally accepted networking methods. The most serious of these is getting
  the proper networking package loaded onto the system, since most environments
  do not come with the network interface packages loaded.

  The second most serious network issue relates to security. The network
  simulation needs to simulate operating system level functionality (packet
  driving). However, the host network programming interfaces tend to operate at
  the user level of functionality, so getting to the full functionality of
  the network interface usually requires that the person executing the
  network code be a privileged user of the host system. See the PCAP/WinPcap
  documentation for the appropriate host platform if unprivileged use of
  networking is needed - there may be known workarounds.

  Define one of the two macros below to enable networking:
    USE_NETWORK - Create statically linked network code
    USE_SHARED  - Create dynamically linked network code

  Compaq Tru64 Unix         ??
  VMS                       Alpha/Itanium VMS only, needs VMS libpcap
  
  WinPcap is available from: 
                        http://winpcap.polito.it/
  libpcap for VMS is available from: 
                        http://simh.trailing-edge.com/sources/vms-pcap.zip
  libpcap for other Unix platforms is available at: 
        NOTE: As of the release of this version of sim_ether.c ALL current 
              *nix platforms ship with a sufficiently new version of 
              libpcap, and ALL provide a libpcap-dev package for developing
              libpcap based applications.  The OS vendor supplied version
              of libpcap AND the libpcap-dev components are preferred for
              proper operation of both simh AND other applications on the 
              host system which use libpcap.
        Current Version:  http://www.tcpdump.org/daily/libpcap-current.tar.gz
        Released Version: http://www.tcpdump.org/release/

        When necessary (see NOTE above about vendor supplied libpcap), 
        we've gotten the tarball, unpacked, built and installed it with:
            gzip -dc libpcap-current.tar.gz | tar xvf -
            cd libpcap-directory-name
            ./configure
            make
            make install
        Note:  The "make install" step generally will have to be done as root.
        This will install libpcap in /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include
        The current simh makefile will do the right thing to locate and 
        reference the OS provided libpcap or the one just installed.


  Note: Building for the platforms indicated above, with the indicated libpcap, 
  should automatically leverage the appropriate mechanisms contained here.  
  Things are structured so that it is likely to work for any other as yet 
  untested platform.  If it works for you, please let the author know so we 
  can update the table above.  If it doesn't work, then the following #define 
  variables can influence the operation on an untested platform.

  USE_BPF           - Determines if this code leverages a libpcap/WinPcap 
                      provided bpf packet filtering facility.  All tested 
                      environments have bpf facilities that work the way we 
                      need them to.  However a new one might not.  undefine 
                      this variable to let this code do its own filtering.
  USE_SETNONBLOCK   - Specifies whether the libpcap environment's non-blocking 
                      semantics are to be leveraged.  This helps to manage the 
                      varying behaviours of the kernel packet facilities 
                      leveraged by libpcap.
  USE_READER_THREAD - Specifies that packet reading should be done in the 
                      context of a separate thread.  The Posix threading 
                      APIs are used.  This option is less efficient than the
                      default non-threaded approach, but it exists since some 
                      platforms don't want to work with nonblocking libpcap 
                      semantics.   OpenBSD and NetBSD either don't have pthread 
                      APIs available, or they are too buggy to be useful. 
                      Using the threaded approach may require special compile 
                      and/or link time switches (i.e. -lpthread or -pthread, 
                      etc.) Consult the documentation for your platform as 
                      needed.  Although this may be 'less efficient' than the
                      non-threaded approach, the efficiency is an overall system
                      efficiency not necessarily a simulator efficiency.  This 
                      means that work is removed from the thread executing 
                      simulated instructions so the simulated system will most
                      likely run faster (given that modern host CPUs are 
                      multi-core and have someplace to do this work in parallel).
  MUST_DO_SELECT    - Specifies that, when USE_READER_THREAD is active,  
                      select() should be used to determine when available 
                      packets are ready for reading.  Otherwise, we depend 
                      on the libpcap/kernel packet timeout specified on 
                      pcap_open_live.  If USE_READER_THREAD is not set, then 
                      MUST_DO_SELECT is irrelevant
  USE_TAP_NETWORK   - Specifies that support for tap networking should be 
                      included.  This can be leveraged, along with OS bridging
                      capabilities to share a single LAN interface.  This 
                      allows device names of the form tap:tap0 to be specified
                      at open time.  This functionality is only useful/needed 
                      on *nix platforms since native sharing of Windows NIC 
                      devices works with no external magic.
  USE_VDE_NETWORK   - Specifies that support for vde networking should be 
                      included.  This can be leveraged, along with OS bridging
                      capabilities to share a single LAN interface.  It also
                      can allow a simulator to have useful networking 
                      functionality when running without root access.  This 
                      allows device names of the form vde:/tmp/switch to be 
                      specified at open time.  This functionality is only 
                      available on *nix platforms since the vde api isn't 
                      available on Windows.

  NEED_PCAP_SENDPACKET
                    - Specifies that you are using an older version of libpcap
                      which doesn't provide a pcap_sendpacket API.

  NOTE: Changing these defines is done in either sim_ether.h OR on the global 
        compiler command line which builds all of the modules included in a
        simulator.

  29-Oct-11  MP   Added support for integrated Tap networking interfaces on OSX
  12-Aug-11  MP   Cleaned up payload length determination
                  Fixed race condition detecting reflections when threaded 
                  reading and writing is enabled
  18-Apr-11  MP   Fixed race condition with self loopback packets in 
                  multithreaded environments
  09-Jan-11  MP   Fixed missing crc data when USE_READER_THREAD is defined and 
                  crc's are needed (only the pdp11_xu)
  16-Dec-10  MP   added priority boost for read and write threads when 
                  USE_READER_THREAD does I/O in separate threads.  This helps
                  throughput since it allows these I/O bound threads to preempt 
                  the main thread (which is executing simulated instructions).                  
  09-Dec-10  MP   allowed more flexible parsing of MAC address strings
  09-Dec-10  MP   Added support to determine if network address conflicts exist
  07-Dec-10  MP   Reworked DECnet self detection to the more general approach
                  of loopback self when a Physical Address is being set.
  04-Dec-10  MP   Changed eth_write to do nonblocking writes when 
                  USE_READER_THREAD is defined.
  20-Aug-10  TVO  Fix for Mac OSX 10.6
  17-Jun-10  MP   Fixed bug in the AUTODIN II hash filtering.
  14-Jun-10  MP   Added support for integrated Tap networking interfaces on BSD 
                  platforms.
  13-Jun-10  MP   Added support for integrated Tap networking interfaces on Linux 
                  platforms.
  31-May-10  MP   Added support for more TOE (TCP Offload Engine) features for IPv4
                  network traffic from the host and/or from hosts on the LAN.  These
                  new TOE features are: LSO (Large Send Offload) and Jumbo packet
                  fragmentation support.  These features allow a simulated network
                  device to support traffic when a host leverages a NIC's Large 
                  Send Offload capabilities to fregment and/or segment outgoing 
                  network traffic.  Additionally a simulated network device can 
                  reasonably exist on a LAN which is configured to use Jumbo frames.
  21-May-10  MP   Added functionality to fixup IP header checksums to accomodate 
                  packets from a host with a NIC which has TOE (TCP Offload Engine)
                  enabled which is expected to implement the checksum computations
                  in hardware.  Since we catch packets before they arrive at the
                  NIC the expected checksum insertions haven't been performed yet.
                  This processing is only done for packets sent from the hoat to 
                  the guest we're supporting.  In general this will be a relatively 
                  small number of packets so it is done for all IP frame packets
                  coming from the hoat to the guest.  In order to make the 
                  determination of packets specifically arriving from the host we
                  need to know the hardware MAC address of the host NIC.  Currently
                  determining a NIC's MAC address is relatively easy on Windows.
                  The non-windows code works on linux and may work on other *nix 
                  platforms either as is or with slight modifications.  The code, 
                  as implemented, only messes with this activity if the host 
                  interface MAC address can be determined.
  20-May-10  MP   Added general support to deal with receiving packets smaller 
                  than ETH_MIN_PACKET in length.  These come from packets
                  looped back by some bridging mechanism and need to be padded
                  to the minimum frame size.  A real NIC won't pass us any 
                  packets like that.  This fix belongs here since this layer
                  is responsible for interfacing to they physical layer 
                  devices, AND it belongs here to get CRC processing right.
  05-Mar-08  MP   Added optional multicast filtering support for doing
                  LANCE style AUTODIN II based hashed filtering.
  07-Feb-08  MP   Added eth_show_dev to display ethernet state
                  Changed the return value from eth_read to return whether
                  or not a packet was read.  No existing callers used or 
                  checked constant return value that previously was being
                  supplied.
  29-Jan-08  MP   Added eth_set_async to provide a mechanism (when 
                  USE_READER_THREAD is enabled) to allow packet reception 
                  to dynamically update the simulator event queue and 
                  potentially avoid polling for I/O.  This provides a minimal 
                  overhead (no polling) maximal responsiveness for network 
                  activities.
  29-Jan-08  MP   Properly sequenced activities in eth_close to avoid a race
                  condition when USE_READER_THREAD is enabled.
  25-Jan-08  MP   Changed the following when USE_READER_THREAD is enabled:
                  - Fixed bug when the simulated device doesn't need crc 
                    in packet data which is read.
                  - Added call to pcap_setmintocopy to minimize packet 
                    delivery latencies.
                  - Added ethq_destroy and used it to avoid a memory leak in
                    eth_close.
                  - Properly cleaned up pthread mutexes in eth_close.
                  Migrated to using sim_os_ms_sleep for a delay instead of
                  a call to select().
                  Fixed the bpf filter used when no traffic is to be matched.
                  Reworked eth_add_packet_crc32 implementation to avoid an
                  extra buffer copy while reading packets.
                  Fixedup #ifdef's relating to USE_SHARED so that setting 
                  USE_SHARED or USE_NETWORK will build a working network 
                  environment.
  23-Jan-08  MP   Reworked eth_packet_trace and eth_packet_trace_ex to allow
                  only output ethernet header+crc and provide a mechanism for
                  the simulated device to display full packet data debugging.
  17-May-07  DTH  Fixed non-ethernet device removal loop (from Naoki Hamada)
  15-May-07  DTH  Added dynamic loading of wpcap.dll;
                  Corrected exceed max index bug in ethX lookup
  04-May-07  DTH  Corrected failure to look up ethernet device names in
                  the registry on Windows XP x64
  10-Jul-06  RMS  Fixed linux conditionalization (from Chaskiel Grundman)
  02-Jun-06  JDB  Fixed compiler warning for incompatible sscanf parameter
  15-Dec-05  DTH  Patched eth_host_devices [remove non-ethernet devices]
                  (from Mark Pizzolato and Galen Tackett, 08-Jun-05)
                  Patched eth_open [tun fix](from Antal Ritter, 06-Oct-05)
  30-Nov-05  DTH  Added option to regenerate CRC on received packets; some
                  ethernet devices need to pass it on to the simulation, and by
                  the time libpcap/winpcap gets the packet, the host OS network
                  layer has already stripped CRC out of the packet
  01-Dec-04  DTH  Added Windows user-defined adapter names (from Timothe Litt)
  25-Mar-04  MP   Revised comments and minor #defines to deal with updated
                  libpcap which now provides pcap_sendpacket on all platforms.
  04-Feb-04  MP   Returned success/fail status from eth_write to support
                  determining if the current libpcap connection can successfully 
                  write packets.
                  Added threaded approach to reading packets since
                  this works better on some platforms (solaris intel) than the 
                  inconsistently implemented non-blocking read approach.
  04-Feb-04  DTH  Converted ETH_DEBUG to sim_debug
  13-Jan-04  MP   tested and fixed on OpenBSD, NetBS and FreeBSD.
  09-Jan-04  MP   removed the BIOCSHDRCMPLT ioctl() for OS/X
  05-Jan-04  DTH  Added eth_mac_scan
  30-Dec-03  DTH  Cleaned up queue routines, added no network support message
  26-Dec-03  DTH  Added ethernet show and queue functions from pdp11_xq
  15-Dec-03  MP   polished generic libpcap support.
  05-Dec-03  DTH  Genericized eth_devices() and #ifdefs
  03-Dec-03  MP   Added Solaris support
  02-Dec-03  DTH  Corrected decnet fix to use reflection counting
  01-Dec-03  DTH  Added BPF source filtering and reflection counting
  28-Nov-03  DTH  Rewrote eth_devices using universal pcap_findalldevs()
  25-Nov-03  DTH  Verified DECNET_FIX, reversed ifdef to mainstream code
  19-Nov-03  MP   Fixed BPF functionality on Linux/BSD.
  17-Nov-03  DTH  Added xBSD simplification
  14-Nov-03  DTH  Added #ifdef DECNET_FIX for problematic duplicate detection code
  13-Nov-03  DTH  Merged in __FreeBSD__ support
  21-Oct-03  MP   Added enriched packet dumping for debugging
  20-Oct-03  MP   Added support for multiple ethernet devices on VMS
  20-Sep-03  Ankan Add VMS support (Alpha only)
  29-Sep-03  MP   Changed separator character in eth_fmt_mac to be ":" to
                  format ethernet addresses the way the BPF compile engine
                  wants to see them.
                  Added BPF support to filter packets
                  Added missing printf in eth_close
  07-Jun-03  MP   Added WIN32 support for DECNET duplicate address detection.
  06-Jun-03  MP   Fixed formatting of Ethernet Protocol Type in eth_packet_trace
  30-May-03  DTH  Changed WIN32 to _WIN32 for consistency
  07-Mar-03  MP   Fixed Linux implementation of PacketGetAdapterNames to also
                  work on Red Hat 6.2-sparc and Debian 3.0r1-sparc.
  03-Mar-03  MP   Changed logging to be consistent on stdout and sim_log
  01-Feb-03  MP   Changed type of local variables in eth_packet_trace to
                  conform to the interface needs of eth_mac_fmt wich produces
                  char data instead of unsigned char data.  Suggested by the
                  DECC compiler.
  15-Jan-03  DTH  Corrected PacketGetAdapterNames parameter2 datatype
  26-Dec-02  DTH  Merged Mark Pizzolato's enhancements with main source
                  Added networking documentation
                  Changed _DEBUG to ETH_DEBUG
  20-Dec-02  MP   Added display of packet CRC to the eth_packet_trace.
                  This helps distinguish packets with identical lengths
                  and protocols.
  05-Dec-02  MP   With the goal of draining the input buffer more rapidly
                  changed eth_read to call pcap_dispatch repeatedly until
                  either a timeout returns nothing or a packet allowed by
